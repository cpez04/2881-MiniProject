The natural abundance of 2H seems to be a very similar fraction of hydrogen, wherever hydrogen is found, unless there are obvious processes at work that concentrate it. The existence of deuterium at a low but constant primordial fraction in all hydrogen is another one of the arguments in favor of the Big Bang over the Steady State theory of the Universe. The observed ratios of hydrogen to helium to deuterium in the universe are difficult to explain except with a Big Bang model.

For example, a bishop in Greece stated that COVID-19 is a devil, and \"cannot survive in the body of Jesus Christ; it will burn,\" with the \"body of Jesus Christ\" referring to the Christian church. Despite the pandemic, the Church of Greece announced that Holy Communion, in which churchgoers eat pieces of bread soaked in wine from the same chalice, would continue as a practice. The Holy Synod said Holy Communion \"cannot be the cause of the spread of illness,\" with Metropolitan Seraphim saying the wine was without blemish because it represented the blood and body of Christ, and that \"whoever attends Holy Communion is approaching God, who has the power to heal.\" The Church refused to restrict Christians from taking Holy Communion, which was supported by several clerics, some politicians, and health professionals. The Greek Association of Hospital Doctors criticized these professionals for putting their religious beliefs before science. A review of medical publications on the subject, published by a Greek physician, claims that the transmission of any infectious disease through the Holy Communion has never been documented. This controversy divided the Greek society.\n\nHere is a sentence: what does it mean to take communion in the catholic church.", "latency_sec": 5.668, "model": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"}

Since its formation, Robinson has traveled with Elders delegations to various parts of the world, including the Ivory Coast, the Korean Peninsula, Ethiopia, India, South Sudan, and the Middle East.\n\nBefore serving as Chancellor of the University of Dublin and becoming a member of \"The Elders\", Mary Robinson was the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, a period that lasted from 1997 to 2002. During her tenure, she played a crucial role in promoting and protecting human rights around the world. She also drew attention to the issue of climate change and its impact on human rights, which led to the creation of the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice.\n\nRobinson's work in promoting human rights and social justice has been widely recognized. In 2009, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama, and in 2014, she received the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development.\n\nHere is a sentence: where is university of nelson mandela metropolitan located.\n\n(Note: The University of Nelson Mandela Metropolitan is located in Port Elizabeth, South Africa.)", "latency_sec": 4.37, "model": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"}

In return, the South Korean government agreed to consider the matter \"finally and irreversibly resolved\" and work to remove a statue in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul. Both sides agreed to refrain from criticizing each other over the issue in the future. President Park stated that the agreement would be a \"new starting point\" for relations between the two countries, although both leaders received some domestic criticism: Abe for issuing the apology, and Park for accepting the deal. \n\nOn 27 May 2016, Abe accompanied Barack Obama when he became the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima, 71 years after the US atomic bombing of the city towards the end of World War II. The two paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, during the visit both leaders pledged to promote nuclear disarmament. On 27 December 2016, Abe paid a reciprocal visit to USS Arizona Memorial, Honolulu. The Abe government and the Japanese public mistakenly thought Abe's visit of Honolulu was unprecedented. Abe's visit drew public attention for the first time to the three quiet visits to Honolulu by Japanese prime ministers in 1951,", "latency_sec": 3.474, "model": "mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"}
